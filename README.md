# BitcoinPaperTrader
A bitcoin paper trader with interactive dynamic candlestick graph
note api keys are read only.

This project was submitted for the Adahackr blackrock hackathon.
The goal of this project was to make a web based, bitcoin paper trader. 
Users would then be able to paper trade on the platform and results would be published on a high scorespage. 
This could then be used to verify the legitamcy of so called 'trading signal' providers, filtering out 'fake gurus' and other scammers.
